# docket network ls
Let's run a nginx container
# docker run -d --name login nginx:latest

Now login to container and install ping 
# docker exec -it login /bin/bash
# apt-get update
# apt-get install iputils-ping -y

Now lets run another container 
# docker run -d --name logout nginx:latest
check both container are running 
docker ps

Now check IP of login and logout container by running 
docker inspect login 172.17.0.2
docker inspect logout 172.17.0.3

Now we will create a new network 
docker network create <network-name>
once network create check by running the command 
docker network ls

Now create a container in new network which is isolated from the other 2 containers
docker run -d --name finance --network secure-network nginx:latest
if you inspect the above container you will find the IP address is completely different from login and logout containe and you cannot ping the conatiner.
this means you finance conatiner is isolated from other 2 containers.

To create a container with host network run below command 
docker run -d --name host-dome --network host nginx:latest

if you inspect above container there will be no IP since it is connected with host network
